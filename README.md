# FuPlot

FuPlot is a ggplot2 inspired framework for creating animatable data visualizations from tabular data for DaVinci Resolve Fusion.

## TODO

- wrap stuff into a group for cleaner node output
- create axes
- customizable scale
- ability to better configure margin and dimensional properties
- geom_point for scatter plots
- geom_col for bar plots
- GUI for use within Fusion in a plugin-like interface
- turn into pip installable package
- make it work as a script in fusion rather than generating text
- figure out how it works in fusion when points are not published
- fix ActiveTool not being the merge
- better separate importing data (should expect clean data) and creating plots workflows
- text
- bg > canvas > axes > geoms > text; the final render should construct these and merge them one by one to generate tools in an organized manner
